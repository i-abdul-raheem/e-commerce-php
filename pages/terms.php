    <p class="mb-3">Once your return is received and inspected, we will send you an email to notify you that we have received your

    <p class="mb-3">If you are approved, then your refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your
        credit card or original method of payment, within a certain amount of days.</p>

    <h6>Late or missing refunds</h6>

    <p class="mb-3">If you haven’t received a refund yet, first check your bank account again.</p>

    <p class="mb-3">Then contact your credit card company, it may take some time before your refund is officially posted.</p>

    <p class="mb-3">Next contact your bank. There is often some processing time before a refund is posted.</p>

    <p class="mb-3">If you’ve done all of this and you still have not received your refund yet, please contact us at {email address}.
    </p>

    <h6>Sale items</h6>

    <p class="mb-3">Only regular priced items may be refunded. Sale items cannot be refunded.</p>

    <h3 class="mt-5">Exchanges</h3>

    <p class="mb-3">We only replace items if they are defective or damaged. If you need to exchange it for the same item, send us an
        email at {email address} and send your item to: {physical address}.</p>

    <h3 class="mt-5">Gifts</h3>

    <p class="mb-3">If the item was marked as a gift when purchased and shipped directly to you, you’ll receive a gift credit for the
        value of your return. Once the returned item is received, a gift certificate will be mailed to you.</p>

    <p class="mb-3">If the item wasn’t marked as a gift when purchased, or the gift giver had the order shipped to themselves to give
        to you later, we will send a refund to the gift giver and they will find out about your return.</p>

    <h3 class="mt-5">Shipping returns</h3>

    <p class="mb-3">To return your product, you should mail your product to: {physical address}.</p>

    <p class="mb-3">You will be responsible for paying for your own shipping costs for returning your item. Shipping costs are
        non-refundable. If you receive a refund, the cost of return shipping will be deducted from your refund.</p>

    <p class="mb-3">Depending on where you live, the time it may take for your exchanged product to reach you may vary.</p>

    <p class="mb-3">If you are returning more expensive items, you may consider using a trackable shipping service or purchasing
        shipping insurance. We don’t guarantee that we will receive your returned item.</p>
